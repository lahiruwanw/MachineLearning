  ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
libs <- c("tidyverse", "ISLR", "modelr", "e1071", "ROCR")
invisible(lapply(libs, library, character.only = TRUE))
```

In clustering, we seek to partition the data into distinct groups so that the observations within each group are quite similar to each other, while observations in different groups are quite different from each other. The two-best known clustering approaches:

1. $K$-means clustering
2. Hierarchical clustering
