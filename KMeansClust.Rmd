  ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
libs <- c("tidyverse", "ISLR", "modelr", "e1071", "ROCR")
invisible(lapply(libs, library, character.only = TRUE))
```

*Step 1: Choose the number $K$ of clusters.

*Step 2: Select at random $K$ points, the centroid (not necessarily from yhr thr dataset).

*Step 3: Assign each data point to the closet centroid. Form the $K$ clusters.

*Step 4: Compute and place the new centroid of each cluster.

*Step 5: Reassign each data point to the new closest centroid. If any reassignemtn took place, then go to Step 4, otherwise this is the final assignment of data points.
